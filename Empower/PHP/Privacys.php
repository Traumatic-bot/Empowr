                Privacy Information
                We respect your privacy

                preserving your online safety and privacy at any time you visit or communicate with our site. Scan are
                the 'data controller' of the personal data that you provide to us.

                Our Privacy Information and Terms of Use offers you a thorough explanation regarding your personal data
                provided to us or any data we may collect from you.

                This Privacy Information is updated from time to time; therefore, it should be reviewed occasionally.
                Last update: 19th May 2025

                Purposes of Processing
                Personal data is collected and processed during the operation of our website, we only store personal
                data for as long as required. We may use third party service providers to help with this processing,
                they act as a 'data processor' on our behalf and only use the data collected in ways we specify for our
                own purposes. The categories of third parties which we work with include IT service providers, Delivery
                Agents, Payment Service Providers and Marketing Companies.

                We only process the minimum personal data necessary and use industry standard data masking techniques
                where possible (pseudonymisation / anonymisation). We have outlined some of this activity and the
                parties involved (data processors unless otherwise stated) below:

                Improving the usability of our website
                We process data such as online identifiers and behavioural data in order to measure performance and
                improve the user experience of our website.

                Our website uses Webtrends to provide A/B testing functionality. This lets us see the impact of changes
                to our website by measuring things like number of clicks on a button. We aggregate the data and use
                statistical analysis to decide which change performed better. We do not use this data to identify you
                directly.

                Our web site may use ContentSquare for measuring customer experience and analytics. ContentSquare may
                record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. The
                information collected does not include bank details or any sensitive personal data. Data collected by
                ContentSquare from our website is for our internal use only and is retained for 13 months before being
                deleted. The information collected is used to improve our website usability and is stored and used for
                aggregated and statistical reporting.

                You can set your preferences around this type of processing on our privacy dashboard.

                Traffic & Security
                When you browse our website the requests are sent via the Cloudflare network. Cloudflare will process
                online identifiers in order to ensure that our traffic is genuine and prevent cyber-attacks such as a
                Denial of Service attack. We will also keep logs of requests to our website, the data collected may
                include your IP addresses.

                Cookies
                We use cookies on our website to enable essential functionality and enhance your experience when
                browsing our site. You can find more information in our cookie policy.

                Reviews / Q&A
                The reviews and Q&A feature on our website is provided by Bazaarvoice, when you leave a review
                Bazaarvoice will collect this data and make quality control checks before publishing it to our website.

                Creating an Online Account
                When you create an online account with us you provide us with information that we use to remember you
                and enable you to check out faster. This also gives you access to features such as Order History, Saved
                Baskets.

                We do not have the ability to recover the password you specify and read it in plain text. This is stored
                in a one-way hashed format which is computed using the key derivation function PBKDF2, using a randomly
                generated salt and very high number of iterations.

                Contacting Us
                When you contact us we will process the data you provided, our agents may access information on your
                account in order to serve you and handle your query. We use Zendesk Chat to provide our live chat
                system.

                Placing an Order
                When you place an order with us we may need to share your data with third parties to process that order.

                We will need to provide your delivery and contact information to the delivery agent that you have chosen
                at checkout (e.g. DPD, UPS).

                The payment information you provided will be used by our payment service providers in order to complete
                the transaction. Any credit card details are securely stored with our Payment Service Provider
                (Braintree / PayPal). For display purposes, we store your credit card number (PAN) in a masked format in
                line with PCI standards. If you have chosen to save your card to your account, we use a token provided
                by Braintree to authorise your credit card on subsequent orders, you can delete any saved cards using My
                Account.

                We will contact you by email to provide you with order status updates, when you give us your mobile
                telephone number we may send you SMS messages for important information about your order.

                When necessary, we may introduce limits on the number of items you may purchase. We will use the
                information that has been provided or collected at checkout to uphold those restrictions. This will
                result in subsequent order attempts to be declined. In extreme cases we may perform further additional
                checks and cancel orders which have breached the terms of sale but have not been flagged at checkout;
                these checks may involve use of publicly available data sources e.g. Companies House, listings on online
                marketplaces. This can happen at any point up until delivery.

                When you begin to place an order with us, if you do not manage to complete a purchase we may contact you
                via email or telephone with a reminder and to offer assistance where required. You can opt out of this
                communication by clicking the link in the footer of the email.

                When you place an order via telephone the call is recorded as evidence of the transaction.

                After your order has been delivered we may contact you to ask you to provide feedback or leave a review
                of the products you purchased.

                Competitions
                We run regular competitions and use a service called Gleam to collect the entries. Gleam act as a data
                processor on our behalf and only collect data for Scan Computers use. We will only use this information
                in order to administer the competition (e.g. choose and contact a winner), and use aggregated data for
                analytical and statistical purposes. We will ask for your consent when entering a competition to do
                this.

                Email Marketing
                We send our email newsletters ('Scanshots') to our customers who have given their consent to receive
                them. We also send these to existing customers who have previously "soft" opted-in and have not
                unsubscribed. We make it very easy to unsubscribe or set your preferences. You can:

                Unsubscribe by using the link provided in any Scanshot email you receive
                Press "unsubscribe" in your email client (supported email clients only)
                Change your preferences on My Account
                Use our email preferences page
                We make every effort to ensure you are still interested in receiving these emails and may automatically
                unsubscribe you if you do not read the emails, or we experience errors sending them to you. We recommend
                you add us to your safe senders list to prevent this.

                In some cases we may email you with information relevant to your browsing or purchasing activity, for
                example when an item in your wishlist has become available to purchase. These emails are sent as a
                legitimate interest to send you relevant communication. You can opt out of these emails at any time by
                clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of the email.

                Performance Monitoring
                Where you consent to allowing cookies, we may use tracking technologies to monitor the performance of
                our marketing campaigns, using tools such as Google Analytics.

                Advertising
                We collect pseudonymised information about your browsing - such as products viewed or purchase - and,
                with your clear opt-in consent, share this data directly with:

                Google Ads for search and display advertising.
                Criteo for dynamic retargeting and look-alike audience building.
                Quantcast (via our agency Dentsu) for campaign measurement, profiling and broader audience insights.
                We only set these advertising cookies once you’ve given consent. You can change your choices or withdraw
                your consent at any time via our Privacy Dashboard or by revisiting our cookie settings; withdrawing
                consent will prevent these advertising cookies from being set, but you will still see ads that are less
                closely tailored to your interests.

                Lawful Basis for Processing
                We process personal data under the following lawful bases:

                Contractual Performance
                We will process your personal data in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you. For example
                when processing an order you have placed with us.

                Legal Obligation
                We may process your personal data under legal obligation where we are required to do so by common law or
                statutory obligation.

                Legitimate Interests
                We may process your personal data in order to meet our legitimate interests, when doing so we have
                considered whether that processing is necessary and balanced it against your interests, rights and
                freedoms. In some cases you have the right to object.

                Some of our legitimate interests are:

                Improving customer experience with our website
                To measure and analyse the performance of our website
                To prevent fraudulent activity on our website
                To prevent multiple purchases of products that have purchase limits in place
                To protect data & network security and ensure data integrity
                To prove a contract
                To prevent cyber attacks
                To market our goods and services to our customers
                Consent
                In some cases, we process your personal data when you have given us consent to do so. If you have given
                us consent then you can contact us at any time to withdraw consent.

                Your Rights
                Under data protection law and GDPR you have a number of rights:

                The right to access
                The right to rectification
                The right to erasure (please be aware this right is not absolute)
                The right to restrict processing
                The right to data portability - you can download your data using My Account
                The right to object
                If you wish to exercise any of these rights you can contact us via our help centre, we will endeavour to
                respond to you as soon as possible and within one calendar month.

                Data Retention
                Data retention of your personal data will vary depending on the nature of the data and the legal or
                contractual obligations requiring its retention. For example this may mean we are required to retain
                your personal data to comply with accounting and tax laws, or for other purposes such as warranty
                fulfilment (e.g. warranty period + 6 months). While your data is held, we may de-identify it via
                pseudonymisation (replacing direct identifiers so you’re no longer directly identifiable but allowing
                re-identification if needed) or anonymisation (irreversibly removing identifiers so it can never be
                re-identified). Once data is no longer required, we regularly review our records and either securely
                delete or permanently anonymise the information.

                Automated Decision Making
                We may use AI-powered automated decision making tools to assess and approve or request your request
                based on factors such as order history, payment risk scores or fraud indicators. We rely on this
                processing under our legitimate interest to improve our efficiency and prevent fraudulent activity. If
                you believe a decision has been made in error, you can request a manual review and meaningful
                information about the logic used. Please see the contact options on our help center to contact the
                relevant team.

                Personal Data Storage
                Locations outside the UK / European Economic Area may be used for transferring data we collect about
                you, e.g. with third-party data processors that rely on cloud services hosted in the US. We take all
                reasonable action to ensure the safety of your personal data in agreement with this Privacy Information
                and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g. adequacy / contractual clauses). Any information we
                are provided will be stored on secure servers. We take all reasonable action to protect information sent
                to us electronically. Where applicable you may be given access to sections of our site that require a
                password. You are responsible for the passwords safety and confidentiality.
