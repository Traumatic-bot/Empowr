    <h1>Empowr'ing People</h1>
    <p>
        At Empowr, we believe that technology should be accessible to everyone.
        Our mission is to make everyday computing, gaming, work, and creativity
        more inclusive for disabled people by offering products that adapt to
        the user - not the other way around.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        We are a specialist assistive technology store focused on providing
        high-quality, adaptive tech solutions for people with a wide range of
        disabilities and access needs. Whether someone has reduced mobility,
        visual impairment, chronic pain, or neurological conditions, we aim to
        offer tools that help them use technology comfortably, confidently,
        and independently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team research and curate products that are designed with accessibility
        in mind - from larger keys and brighter colours, to fully hands-free
        control systems. We work to remove barriers, not add new ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Our Customers</h2>
    <p>
        We know that no two people have the same needs. Our goal is to help customers find
        the right combination of tools so they can work, learn, game and communicate in the
        way that suits them best. As our product range grows, we continue to look for new solutions
        that remove barriers and promote digital inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or specific accessibility requirements, please visit our
        <a href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">Contact Us</a> page - we're always happy to help.
